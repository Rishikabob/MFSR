# Milestone 4

## A. High Fiedelity Prototype

### Teacher View Prototpye

The User Stories below is what we implemented in our Teacher View prototype.
#### User Story 1
- **As a teacher I want to be able to communicate to my students though a simple chat box so that I can quickly communicate any concerning issues.**
  - For this user story, we included a chat icon at the top bar that is easily identifiable to the user. This chat icon will also show a red dot indicating new messages or new alerts. Upon click the chat icon, a drop down chat menu will pop up showing the most recent chat messages. A user with an active alert will have a red icon on their name. These design elements make it easier for the teacher to see any issues a student might have during a class since it will notify them directly on their screen. Also, the chat functionality allows the teacher to quickly communicate answers to the student all in one location.

#### User Story 2
- **As a teacher, I want to be able to see my studentsâ€™ screens so that I can quickly focus my attention on a student that needs help.**
  - In the application, the teacher will always be able to see all the students screen on the main screen of the application. When searching for a student, a red dot will be next to their name, indicating that the student has an active alert and needs help. Upon clicking on the students name, the teacher can view their screen, chat with the student, or control their screen. This functionality allows the teacher to directly address any problem the student is having. The screen share functionality makes it easier for the teacher to see the students' thought process and the teacher can then chat with the student to suggest changes or solutions.

#### Student View Prototpye

The User Stories below is what we implemented in our Student View prototype.

#### User Story 3
- **As a student, I want to be able to alert my professor that I have a question so that I can receive help.**
  - In this user story, the student will always have the top menu bar active no matter what other application they are on. If a student runs into any problems while doing their assignment, they can create an alert by clicking on the alert icon on the top. Once they click on the icon, they can put in a message along with their alert to notify the teacher that they have a problem. The student can also send an alert while in the chat menu. Instead of raising your hand or walking up to the professor at the front of the classroom, the student can simply create an alert and wait where they are until the professor addresses their issue.

#### User Story 4
- **As a student I want to see questions and answers to common questions at the top so that the same question is not being answered multiple times**
  - This user story addresses the issue of repeated questions and allows other students to chime in to reduce load on the professor. The student can access the general questions page by clicking on the icon at the top of their screen. They will then be brought to the discussion board page where they can see questions other students had and answers from either the professor or other students. While working on an activity it is not uncommon for students to run into the same issue and instead of asking the same question to the professor, the student can view this discussion board first to see if their problem is addressed in there. This board will expedite the rate at which students will get answers to their problems and will reduce the amount of questions the professor has to individually respond to.
