## Problem Introduction


In traditional and scale-up classrooms dependent on computers, students and professors have difficulty communicating amongst one another regarding the work at hand. There are a multitude of factors that contribute to this issue. For instance, the properties of a traditional classroom include desks and chairs assembled in rows and columns. A scale-up classroom involves properties such as circular desks spread around the room. The layout of scale up classrooms signifies group work and easy mobility due to a large amount of space but it loses sight of student and instructor communication. Currently, scale-up classrooms do not afford professor and student communication due to a multitude of students and questions, and yet a lack of time.  It is difficult for professors to walk through the tiny spaces between the desks in traditional and scale-up settings. Teachers spend an unnecessary amount of time navigating through students to reach anyone with a question. This can also be an issue when there are multiple students with questions. In such a scenario, teachers are stuck not only trying to get to the students but also figuring out which student raised their hand first. 

This issue pertains to face-to-face instruction in computing education since it involves classrooms that are fully synchronous and in-person. This issue depends on the use of computers for instruction and affects both instructors and students.

The main goal of the student when he or she has a question is to get that question answered. The execution towards getting this question answered involves a plan, action sequence of identifying the behavior and performing the planned action. The action taken by a student is usually raising their hand in the air to indicate to the professor that he or she has a question. The perception of this action is whether it worked or not. Sometimes, the teacher notices right away and is able to attend to the matter. Other times, there are other students who need to be attended to first. This usual action does result in the desired goal, and the student can compare the outcome with the goal. This interaction is very typical because it has been witnessed multiple times.
