# Student and Professor Interactions

## Synopsis
In a traditional coding classroom, professors have a hard time reaching students for one on one instruction. There are a multitude of factors that contribute to this issue. For instance, it is difficult to walk through the tiny spaces between the desks that are usually assembled in rows. Teachers spend an unnecessary amount of time navigating through students to reach anyone with a question. This can also be an issue when there are multiple students with questions. In such a scenario, teachers are stuck not only trying to get to the students but also figuring out which student raised their hand first. 
These issues are also prevalent within scale-up classrooms. These classrooms provide more room for the professors to walk, as well as a closer view of the board for the students. However, students are still apart from one another, and the teacher could potentially have to walk back and forth within different groups to answer questions.  Additionally, time is an issue in both types of classrooms. Generally, in a coding-based class, professors take some time to lecture at the beginning of class, and then, the students are given some time to practice with activities. Classes last 50 - 75 minutes. This is usually not enough time for the professors to lecture and walk around to answer any individual and unique questions a student may have about their code. The classroom layout and technology constraints greatly contribute to our problem. It is unique to face-to-face instruction since labs are done in a group setting. This problem affects students in a lab setting and can be recognized in both hybrid and in-person classes. The problem affects both instructors and students.
